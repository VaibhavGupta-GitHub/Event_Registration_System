# Event_Registration_System
Hi this was my first project.
it is most basic and you can easily use it.
Just download the zip file and extract it or downlowad all the files other then the zip one and
add .html files on a saperate folder named templates.
than add other left files like app.py, event.data and tickets.data 
on the same directory.
You will need python and flask installed in your system to run the project 
I have used python for backend
Html and Bootstrap for frontend
Flask for framework (connecting frontend and backend)
and Pickle by python for database.
Have fun enjoy the project...
